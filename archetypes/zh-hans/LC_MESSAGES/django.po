msgid "Token Druid has been a long standing archetype in Hearthstone and it's one of the best Druid options right now. The deck is based around flooding the board with small, summoned minions (tokens), buffing them and bursting the opponent down."
msgstr "超生德是炉石传说中一个历史悠久的标准套牌，它现在也是德鲁伊最好的套牌选择之一。这个套牌基于快速铺场小型随从得名，并且同时Buff他们并击败敌人。"

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/odd-rogue-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Odd Rogue is the class’ latest tempo archetype that relies on Baku the Mooneater’s powerful ability to provide an extremely effective hero power alongside an aggressive package of cards to quickly close out games. It’s one of the strongest decks in the Witchwood metagame and one that can single-handedly get you to high ranks if you figure out its finicky little details in the more problematic matchups."
msgstr "奇数贼是最新的节奏套牌，依靠巴库的强大能力提供强大的英雄技能以及一系列快攻卡牌疯狂走脸结束游戏。它也是目前女巫森林环境中最强的卡组之一，如果你能注意对局细节，可以很快用它来上分。"

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/egg-cube-hunter-deck-list-guide/
msgid "While Egg Cube Hunter or Deathrattle Hunter might look similar to another Hunter archetype, which got popular during this expansion - Recruit Hunter - in reality, these are vastly different archetypes. Recruit Hunter focuses on overwhelming the opponent with big minions dropped every turn starting from Turn 6, most notably Charged Devilsaur and King Krush to land a massive face hit right away. Egg Cube Hunter is a bit different. Instead, it wants to win the game through tempo gains from its Deathrattle minions and proccing them multiple times."
msgstr "蛋蛋魔块猎或者亡语猎看起来像类似的另外一个猎人套牌，这版本刚刚流行的套牌——招募猎。实际上，这些都是不套的套牌类型。招募猎主要靠6费之后每回合一个的大随从压制对手，比如说带冲锋的魔暴龙和暴龙王直接走脸。蛋蛋魔块猎则有一些不同，它获得胜利的手法是从亡语随从中获得节奏优势并且多次触发亡语。"

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/heal-zoo-warlock-deck-list-guide/
msgid "While Zoo Warlock is a very old archetype, one of the Hearthstone's classic, players have tried a new approach to the deck late in The Witchwood meta. Zoo is naturally a deck that takes a lot of damage. Usually, it doesn't matter - if you're the aggressive one, your health total is not a big deal. There seemed to be no point in playing healing before. However, this build plays healing not only for the sake of gaining health, but also because of the synergies."
msgstr "虽然动物园是一个非常古老的套牌，炉石传说经典套牌之一。但是玩家在女巫森林版本尝试了新的构筑体系。动物园通常是一个造成自残的套牌，不过只要快速走脸赢得游戏，血量无所谓。所以治疗恢复对快攻来说没什么用处。但是现在的构筑中治疗恢复不仅可以获得生命值，还可以触发额外卡牌的效果。"

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/quest-priest-deck-list-guide/
msgid "The Priest Quest, Awaken the Makers, was added to Hearthstone in Journey to Un'Goro, but it took more than a year until Quest Priest became a somewhat viable archetype. Quest Priest is able to defend itself against most of the current aggressive decks and it can outvalue some of the Control ones, but it still has weaknesses against Combo builds, which are very popular on the ladder."
msgstr "牧师的任务唤醒造物者，是探索安戈洛版本新加入的卡牌，但是直到一年后，任务牧才成为一个可用的构筑套牌。任务牧面对的快攻卡组，可以保护自己，这点做的比控制牧更好。但是他面对一些天梯主流的组合技卡组非常疲软。"

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/witchwood-tempo-mage-deck-list-guide-standard/
msgid "Tempo Mage is one of the old Hearthstone archetypes, which was present through the game's history in many different forms. Funnily enough, the current version looks similar to the ones that were played back in the day, even before Blackrock Mountain. With some Secret and Spell synergies, as well as multiple ways to burn down the opponent, it wants to finish the games in an explosive manner."
msgstr "节奏法也是炉石传说的古老套牌之一，也体现了炉石不同时期的环境。有意思的是当前版本看起来和上版本的构筑类似，甚至和黑石山的版本差不多。使用大量奥秘并配合法术，同时有各种方法打死对手。也是一个快速走脸结束游戏的套牌。"

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/cube-taunt-druid-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Taunt Druid is one of the brand new archetypes spawned by The Witchwood, which relies on Knights of the Frozen Throne’s Hadronox, Witching Hour + Carnivorous Cube and a healthy dose of Taunt minions. In the late game, it creates a nearly unanswerable board states, which immediately seal the game against Aggro and even most of the Control decks."
msgstr "墙德是女巫森林兴起的新星套牌之一，靠冰封王座骑士版本的哈多诺克斯和巫术时刻还有食肉魔块以及一系列的嘲讽随从构成。在最新版本中，它可以瞬间制造出无法处理的场面，直接决定和快攻套牌甚至大多数控制套牌的胜利。"

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/witchwood-big-spell-mage-deck-list-guide/
msgid "One could say that the history of the Big Spell Mage started in Un'Goro with Burn Mage, a slow deck, which wanted to control the board through majority of the game, and then turn around and start killing your opponent with big tempo swings. This deck is similar, but it leans even more on the control side thanks to the late game capabilities of Frost Lich Jaina. The \"real\" Big Spell Mage was created in Kobolds & Catacombs, when Dragon's Fury, Dragoncaller Alanna as well as a few more \"Big Spell\" synergies were printed."
msgstr "可以说龙怒控制法的历史能追溯到安戈洛时期的打脸冰法，同为一套慢速卡组并且在对局的大部分时间内都能控住场面，最后在对手节奏断档时反转对抗。这套卡组也是类似的，但得益于冰霜女巫吉安娜的强大后期能力，它更偏向于控制。确切地说，龙怒控制法真正起源是狗头人与地下世界的巨龙之怒的发布时，以及巨龙召唤者奥兰纳及其配合的“大法术”的加入。"

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/spell-hunter-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Spell Hunter is a very unique archetype, in a way that it doesn't run any minions for the sake of cards such as To My Side! and Rhok'delar. The class still has multiple ways to flood the board or drop big bodies, but in order to do that, it uses spells (e.g. Emerald Spellstone) and a Hero card - Deathstalker Rexxar."
msgstr "法术猎是一套别致的卡组，它不携带任何随从以触发诸如来我身边！和伦鲁迪洛尔之类的卡牌。这个卡组仍然有很多方法铺场或者压大随从，但只是通过法术（例如法术翡翠）和英雄牌——死亡猎手雷克萨。"

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/even-warlock-handlock-deck-guide-witchwood/
msgid "Even Warlock is a new version of Handlock, a classic deck that got its name from massive hand sizes it could attain easily thanks to the Warlock's Hero Power - Life Tap - and Genn Greymane made it even easier to do so. Thanks to that hand size, Even Warlock can play big threats such as Mountain Giant or Twilight Drake as early as Turn 4, overwhelming most of the meta decks with the sheer amount of stats it places on the board each turn."
msgstr "偶数术是新版的手牌术，这两套牌同样可以通过术士的英雄技能——生命分流维持大量的手牌，吉恩·格雷迈恩更是加强了这一点。得益于手牌量，偶数术可以在4费时造成很多大威胁，例如山岭巨人或者暮光幼龙。这些都能压制环境中的其他卡组每回合能置入场面的随从。"

msgid "Even Shaman is a board-centric midrange deck that uses buffs to make use of the Totem boards it is able to build, and also makes good use of Charge minions to get even more value from its buffs. It is ready to fight for the board against any other deck and can deliver a lot of damage quickly if left uncontested."
msgstr "偶数萨是围绕场面展开的中速卡组，用buff来利用图腾场面，buff配合冲锋随从时产生的价值就更大了。偶数撒很容易在其他卡组面前控制住场面，如果不受威胁的话场面的输出亦很可观。"

msgid "Odd Paladin's main power is the upgraded Hero Power activated by Baku the Mooneater. The deck is built around flooding the board all the time - with 2x 1/1 Hero Power and a bunch of other ways to summon multiple small minions, the deck takes advantage of all kinds of AoE buffs, even cards that were only used in Basic decks before, such as Raid Leader or Stormwind Champion."

msgid "Centered around Kathrena Winterwisp (as well as Seeping Oozeling to copy her Deathrattle), Recruit Hunter can rip large minions from your deck directly into play. Given that Battlecries don't trigger when the minion is Recruited, the deck seeks to nullify the downsides of cards such as Witchwood Grizzly (losing health) and Charged Devilsaur (not being able to attack opponent's Hero on the first turn)."

msgid "In the past, Control Priest was a very slow, reactive deck, which put attrition as its main win condition. Right now, while the deck still keeps its reactive nature, its main win condition shifted to chip damage from Shadowreaper Anduin and burst from Mind Blasts (hence the deck's second name - Mind Blast Priest)."

msgid "Malygos Druid is a combo deck built around its namesake, Malygos. Thanks to the +5 Spell Damage provided by the Dragon, even the weakest damage spells (such as Moonfire) turn into powerful burns. Given the card's high 9 mana cost, normally you can't do much with the remaining 1 mana. That problem is fixed by Twig of the World Tree, giving Druid extra 10 mana to copy Malygos or play more expensive spells."

msgid "Quest Warrior's main game plan is to play defensively throughout the early and mid game, dropping Taunt after Taunt to finish the Quest. Quest's reward turns your Hero Power into \"Deal 8 damage to a random enemy\" - so at the cost of 2 mana per turn, you basically become a Ragnaros the Firelord for the rest of the game. Clearing a minion or dealing 8 damage to the opponent every turn becomes your main win condition."

The deck is all about cycling (Gadgetzan Auctioneer or Sprint) and swinging the tempo in many ways (clearing big minions, flooding the board etc.), thanks to the cards like Sap, Vilespine Slayer, Edwin VanCleef or Fal'dorei Strider."

The archetype can adjust its play style depending on the opponent it faces - with many removals (including AoE) and Taunts it can shut down Aggro, while the Doomguard combos give it a great win condition in slower matchups."

Current version is often called Hybrid Hunter, because the build is something between the classic Aggro and Midrange versions, dropping some of the late game minions and focusing more on the early and mid game pressure."

It's a revival of a very old Hearthstone deck - Hunter was always known for its aggression, thanks to the Hero Power and cards that let you deal additional damage on top of that (such as Kill Command or Eaglehorn Bow). With the introduction of Baku the Mooneater, the build is now able to deal 3 damage every turn instead of 2 thanks to the upgraded Hero Power."

The deck was hurt heavily by the Witchwood nerf patch, but some players are still trying to keep it alive."
