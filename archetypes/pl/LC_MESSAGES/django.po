msgstr ""

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/odd-rogue-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Odd Rogue is the class’ latest tempo archetype that relies on Baku the Mooneater’s powerful ability to provide an extremely effective hero power alongside an aggressive package of cards to quickly close out games. It’s one of the strongest decks in the Witchwood metagame and one that can single-handedly get you to high ranks if you figure out its finicky little details in the more problematic matchups."
msgstr ""

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/egg-cube-hunter-deck-list-guide/
msgid "While Egg Cube Hunter or Deathrattle Hunter might look similar to another Hunter archetype, which got popular during this expansion - Recruit Hunter - in reality, these are vastly different archetypes. Recruit Hunter focuses on overwhelming the opponent with big minions dropped every turn starting from Turn 6, most notably Charged Devilsaur and King Krush to land a massive face hit right away. Egg Cube Hunter is a bit different. Instead, it wants to win the game through tempo gains from its Deathrattle minions and proccing them multiple times."
msgstr ""

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/heal-zoo-warlock-deck-list-guide/
msgid "While Zoo Warlock is a very old archetype, one of the Hearthstone's classic, players have tried a new approach to the deck late in The Witchwood meta. Zoo is naturally a deck that takes a lot of damage. Usually, it doesn't matter - if you're the aggressive one, your health total is not a big deal. There seemed to be no point in playing healing before. However, this build plays healing not only for the sake of gaining health, but also because of the synergies."
msgstr ""

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/quest-priest-deck-list-guide/
msgid "The Priest Quest, Awaken the Makers, was added to Hearthstone in Journey to Un'Goro, but it took more than a year until Quest Priest became a somewhat viable archetype. Quest Priest is able to defend itself against most of the current aggressive decks and it can outvalue some of the Control ones, but it still has weaknesses against Combo builds, which are very popular on the ladder."

msgid "Tempo Mage is one of the old Hearthstone archetypes, which was present through the game's history in many different forms. Funnily enough, the current version looks similar to the ones that were played back in the day, even before Blackrock Mountain. With some Secret and Spell synergies, as well as multiple ways to burn down the opponent, it wants to finish the games in an explosive manner."
msgstr ""

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/cube-taunt-druid-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Taunt Druid is one of the brand new archetypes spawned by The Witchwood, which relies on Knights of the Frozen Throne’s Hadronox, Witching Hour + Carnivorous Cube and a healthy dose of Taunt minions. In the late game, it creates a nearly unanswerable board states, which immediately seal the game against Aggro and even most of the Control decks."
msgstr ""

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/witchwood-big-spell-mage-deck-list-guide/
msgid "One could say that the history of the Big Spell Mage started in Un'Goro with Burn Mage, a slow deck, which wanted to control the board through majority of the game, and then turn around and start killing your opponent with big tempo swings. This deck is similar, but it leans even more on the control side thanks to the late game capabilities of Frost Lich Jaina. The \"real\" Big Spell Mage was created in Kobolds & Catacombs, when Dragon's Fury, Dragoncaller Alanna as well as a few more \"Big Spell\" synergies were printed."
msgstr ""

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/spell-hunter-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Spell Hunter is a very unique archetype, in a way that it doesn't run any minions for the sake of cards such as To My Side! and Rhok'delar. The class still has multiple ways to flood the board or drop big bodies, but in order to do that, it uses spells (e.g. Emerald Spellstone) and a Hero card - Deathstalker Rexxar."

msgid "Even Warlock is a new version of Handlock, a classic deck that got its name from massive hand sizes it could attain easily thanks to the Warlock's Hero Power - Life Tap - and Genn Greymane made it even easier to do so. Thanks to that hand size, Even Warlock can play big threats such as Mountain Giant or Twilight Drake as early as Turn 4, overwhelming most of the meta decks with the sheer amount of stats it places on the board each turn."

msgid "Centered around Kathrena Winterwisp (as well as Seeping Oozeling to copy her Deathrattle), Recruit Hunter can rip large minions from your deck directly into play. Given that Battlecries don't trigger when the minion is Recruited, the deck seeks to nullify the downsides of cards such as Witchwood Grizzly (losing health) and Charged Devilsaur (not being able to attack opponent's Hero on the first turn)."
msgstr ""

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/mind-blast-control-priest-deck-list-guide/
msgid "In the past, Control Priest was a very slow, reactive deck, which put attrition as its main win condition. Right now, while the deck still keeps its reactive nature, its main win condition shifted to chip damage from Shadowreaper Anduin and burst from Mind Blasts (hence the deck's second name - Mind Blast Priest)."

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/malygos-druid-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Malygos Druid is a combo deck built around its namesake, Malygos. Thanks to the +5 Spell Damage provided by the Dragon, even the weakest damage spells (such as Moonfire) turn into powerful burns. Given the card's high 9 mana cost, normally you can't do much with the remaining 1 mana. That problem is fixed by Twig of the World Tree, giving Druid extra 10 mana to copy Malygos or play more expensive spells."

msgid "Quest Warrior's main game plan is to play defensively throughout the early and mid game, dropping Taunt after Taunt to finish the Quest. Quest's reward turns your Hero Power into \"Deal 8 damage to a random enemy\" - so at the cost of 2 mana per turn, you basically become a Ragnaros the Firelord for the rest of the game. Clearing a minion or dealing 8 damage to the opponent every turn becomes your main win condition."

msgid "Miracle Rogue has changed many times since its inception, and the original concept of growing minions comes and goes, but many features of Miracle decks have remained the same, especially their heavy emphasis on card draw and swing turns. The deck is all about cycling (Gadgetzan Auctioneer or Sprint) and swinging the tempo in many ways (clearing big minions, flooding the board etc.), thanks to the cards like Sap, Vilespine Slayer, Edwin VanCleef or Fal'dorei Strider."
msgstr ""

#: http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/battlecry-shudderwock-combo-shaman-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Shudderwock Shaman is the new Combo deck from the Witchwood. The idea behind it is to play all of the combo pieces throughout the game, then repeat all of their Battlecries with Shudderwock. If everything goes right, you end up with a bunch of 1 mana Shudderwocks in your hand, being able to do the same thing over and over again (including dealing damage/healing from Lifedrinker, your main win condition)."

msgid "Cube Warlock is a slow Warlock archetype first introduced in Kobolds & Catacombs, and it's somewhat of a mix between Midrange, Control and a Combo deck. The archetype can adjust its play style depending on the opponent it faces - with many removals (including AoE) and Taunts it can shut down Aggro, while the Doomguard combos give it a great win condition in slower matchups."

In Year of the Raven, there is no universally accepted build, and the deck has lots of clear weaknesses, but it's still possible to snatch some wins thanks to the massive minions you can build during the early and mid game."

msgid "Midrange Hunter is one of the oldest archetypes in Hearthstone, it was present in nearly every meta in one form or the other, but always with a similar basic strategy and Beast synergies. Current version is often called Hybrid Hunter, because the build is something between the classic Aggro and Midrange versions, dropping some of the late game minions and focusing more on the early and mid game pressure."

msgid "Tempo Rogue is an aggressive Rogue deck. It is not a pure face deck, but rather seeks to establish board control, push damage with minions, and optionally end the game with a burst finish of up to 20 points of damage, but more often closer to 10 points of damage."

msgid "Baku Odd Face Hunter, or just Face Hunter, is the most aggressive deck on the ladder right now. It's a revival of a very old Hearthstone deck - Hunter was always known for its aggression, thanks to the Hero Power and cards that let you deal additional damage on top of that (such as Kill Command or Eaglehorn Bow). With the introduction of Baku the Mooneater, the build is now able to deal 3 damage every turn instead of 2 thanks to the upgraded Hero Power."

msgid "Spiteful Priest sacrifices all of the cheap spells and plays only two expensive ones - Free from Amber and Mind Control. Thanks to that, both Spiteful Summoner and Grand Archivist (two of the deck's main win conditions) always pull a big spell for their powerful effects."

msgid "Demon Control Warlock is a deck first created in Kobolds & Catacombs, which shares a lot of similarities with Cube Warlock - both rely on cheating out bigger minions early, as well as massive late game tempo swing with Bloodreaver Gul'dan. However, unlike Cube Warlock, Control version takes a much more reactive route, switching out threats for removals. The deck was hurt heavily by the Witchwood nerf patch, but some players are still trying to keep it alive."
